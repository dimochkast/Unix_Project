# guessinggame.sh Project

##This is my coursera Guessing game project

To start this programm simply type guessinggame.sh into your command line.

You will get the following:
`How many files are in this directory`
Type in a number, if the number is too low the programm will tell you that it is too low,
if it's too high the programm will tell you that it is too high
The programm will stop only when you guess the number of files in the current directory correctly.
